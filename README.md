You can see my webpage on this [link](https://mariiad1997.github.io/bof-CSS/)

## Requirements

1. Using vanilla CSS or SASS (either .sass or .scss) for styling (No styling library allowed)
2. Floating the HTML elements using Flexbox and Grid system
3. Implementing basic animations as shown in the webpage (hover effect,
   active link styles, typing effect). You can modify the outlook of the effects

This assignment only requires 1 static page (index.html). No JavaScript needed.
Font family and text content can be modified as your preferences.
You can ignore the small buttons/tags/lables in each card. Only
texts with some styles are enough.

## Working with CSS

If you choose to use CSS, you can create a .css file called styles.css inside the styles folder and change link to the css file in the index.html

## Working with SCSS

1. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
2. Main styling file is styles.scss, which will be compiled into css file later with `npm start` command
3. You can choose to use partial scss file to devide your codes into multiple files (optional)
4. Run the command `npm start`, and changes in the scss files will be compiled into css
